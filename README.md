# Forecast-Report-of-Passenger-Car-Segment-Sales
This report is intended to complete the passenger car segment sales forecast based on the data set given. Because there are fewer data column vector labels, the focus is on mining the same label (sales volume) about the periodic/non-cyclical change processes of other elements. Based on the characteristic engineering of calculating time-lapse features, combining time-lapse features, historical sales characteristics, historical characteristic statistical functions, the lgb decision tree model is used to fit sales volume. Using the cross-month method, the error transmission is avoided, and the final submission accuracy score is 0.571, compared with the historical high of 0.65. In the future, we may consider using LSTM's deep learning method to strengthen learning, explore hidden relationships, and improve accuracy.
